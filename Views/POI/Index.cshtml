                <p>This is the <i>pitch</i> - that is, a super short description of your idea. It is often referred to as an elevator pitch as you should be able to deliver the pitch in the time it takes to ride an elevator from the ground to the investors on the top floor. The pitch is one of the most important tools of an entrepreneur - you never know who you may run into at work, at a reception or in the supermarket, so your pitch should always be sharp.</p>
                <p>Your pitch should be a precise and intriguing summary compiled of your answers to the following questions: What's the problem/need? What's the solution? Who will it help? How can we make money? And what do we need in order to move forward?</p>
                <p>Start out by discussing these questions in your team or with friends. You can always return to your pitch and make it even sharper.</p>
                <p>When you have finished your pitch - try it out on 5 people from your network, who can give you valuable feedback - what works and what dosen't? Note their feedback and incorporate this into your pitch. Remember- your pitch should be as short and simple so everybody can understand it.</p>

                <p>The elevator pitch should cover the basics, not necessarily in this order: What, who and why.</p>
                <p><strong>WHAT</strong>. Describe what are you doing - are you making a product or offering a service? <br />-> "We make widgets widget for..."</p>
                <p><strong>WHO</strong>. Describe the customer (be specific enough that people see the market, but not so specific that people wonder if there are more than of these people in the world): <br />-> "We make widgets for recreational widgeteers..."</p>
                <p><strong>WHY</strong>. Describe why you are special. What will differentiate from competitors in the market? <br />-> "We're the first company for recreational widgeteers" or "We make widgets for recreational widgeteers that are half the price and fly twice the distance of current widgets"</p>
                <h4>A FEW ADVICES:</h4>
                <p><strong>Avoid the technical jargon</strong>. The idea is for someone to respond with "That's interesting, tell me more." Then you can add technical jargon and explain your advantages.</p>
                <p><strong>Avoid the sales pitch</strong>. The elevator pitch is for explaining what you are doing and initiating an conversation. Don't use it to sell your product or for that matter your company.</p>

                <p>If you do not have a product, it can be good to have physical aid to describe your idea to potential customers - an example of such is the mockups used in web- and app-development. You should consider which aid you need in order to show and describe your idea to customers - and reap the benefits of their early feedback.</p>
                <p>Do a small sketch, silde deck, prototype, mockup or whatever feels the best for you; it does not have to be fancy or in its final form; there are plenty of time for optimization. The most important thing is that you try to develop an aid that can help you make your customers understand, try out or see your idea.</p>

When thinking about similar solutions in the market, is it also important to consider the subsitutes to your product or service. For example, margarine is a substitute for butter because a consumer can meet similar needs by using margarine.</p>
                <p>Start out by doing a small-scale market research - often a Google search can be a sufficient place to start to identify potential competitors. Search for similar solutions to your problem. Identify both direct competitors and substitutes to your product or service.

                <p>You have already identified your competitors. Now, take it a step further, and understand how your solution differs from the solutions of your competitors.</p>
                <p>This is referred to as the unique selling points of your solution. Unique selling points may be expressed as a summary of what you do and how you do it better or differently than others.

No matter how you express it, your unique selling point should focus on how it benefits the customer.</p> <br />
                <p>This step demands some research on your competitors' products/services and their unique selling points. How does your solution differ from the solutions offered by competitors? To answer this you can start by investigating these questions (focus on one company at a time):</p>
                <p>What are your competitors doing really well? What are your competitors doing poorly?</p>
                <p>Use your findings to try and benchmark your idea against your biggest competitors.</p>
                <p>Maybe you can be inspired by what they are doing really well and improve on what they are doing poorly. This will make you sharper on your unique selling points.</p>
